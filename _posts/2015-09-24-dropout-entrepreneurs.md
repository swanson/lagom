Hear about the experiences of some of the nation's top entrepreneurs. They will be sharing the stories of their time working full-time rather than attending classes and what to expect from being a young entrepreneur. After each talks about their individual paths there will be a panel discussion about the entrepreneurial journey.

Keynote:
Prof Laura Huang of the Wharton Entrepreneurship Dept. conducts research that examines early-stage investment decisions, and how perceptions and cues influence an individuals’ ability to make important, high-stakes decisions. She is currently studying how an investor’s gut feel plays a role in entrepreneurial decision-making, in addition to business viability data. 

Panelists:
Justin Lafazan is the Founder and CEO of Next Gen Summit which was ranked one of the top conferences for entrepreneurs under 30 to attend.

George Beall is the Founder and CEO of Touch Tiles which aims to create completely customizable smart devices by allowing users to create touchscreens of any size or shape and with any accessories, using Touch Tiles.

Toni Oloko is the Founder and CEO of Practice Gigs which wants to simplify the process of finding players to practice against for tennis. With massive growth Practice Gigs is on track to become the Uber of sports training.
