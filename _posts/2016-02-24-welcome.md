This [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) style is based on [lagom](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) with some additional features. In the posts you can:

* use advanced math (via MathJax), both inline, like $\sin{90^{\circ}} = 1$, and displayed:
    \begin{equation}
        \int{\frac{\log{x}}{\sum_{n=1}^{5}{x^n}} dx}
        \label{eq:1}
    \end{equation}
  math can be also referenced: \eqref{eq:1}
* include images which will be centered and properly resized: ![picture](/images/testimage.png)
* use github mentions @mrkwjc
* include inline emoji like this :smile: :+1: an this :rage: :-1: and [more](http://emoji.codes/)
* allow commenting things by setting your disqs name in settings.

## Enjoy!
